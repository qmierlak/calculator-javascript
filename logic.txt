Here's what I'm thinking for the logic:

There will be boolean variables to track whether num1 has been entered

When you click + - * or /, it will take the display value and save that to num1
it should also store the operator to calculate once you hit equals

Clear sets the boolean for both num1 and 2 to 0.

When you click equals, it will save the display value into num 2 and then call
operate on the operator you clicked with num1 and display the result.  Any button
press after that should essentially call clear before displaying numbers'
and reset the boolean values
